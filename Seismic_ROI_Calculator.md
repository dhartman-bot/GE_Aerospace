# Seismic x Anthropic: ROI Calculator Framework
## Quantifying Partnership Value

---

## Overview

This ROI calculator helps quantify the financial impact of integrating Claude API and Claude Code into Seismic's platform. All numbers are estimates based on industry benchmarks and should be customized with Seismic's actual data.

---

## Part 1: Revenue Impact

### A. Customer Expansion Revenue (Existing Customers)

**Assumptions**:
- Current customer base: 15,000 enterprise customers
- Average contract value (ACV): $50,000
- AI premium tier pricing: +$15,000/year (30% premium)
- Adoption rate targets:
  - Year 1: 10% of customers upgrade to AI tier
  - Year 2: 25% of customers
  - Year 3: 40% of customers

**Calculations**:

```
Year 1 Expansion:
15,000 customers × 10% adoption × $15,000 premium = $22.5M ARR

Year 2 Expansion:
15,000 customers × 25% adoption × $15,000 premium = $56.25M ARR

Year 3 Expansion:
15,000 customers × 40% adoption × $15,000 premium = $90M ARR
```

**3-Year Total: $168.75M incremental ARR**

---

### B. New Customer Acquisition

**Assumptions**:
- Current new customer acquisition: 2,000 customers/year
- Current win rate: 25%
- AI-differentiated win rate: 35% (+10 percentage points)
- Average new customer ACV: $45,000

**Calculations**:

```
Current annual wins: 8,000 opportunities × 25% = 2,000 customers

With AI differentiation: 8,000 opportunities × 35% = 2,800 customers

Incremental wins: 800 additional customers/year

Revenue impact:
Year 1: 800 × $45,000 × 0.5 (half-year effect) = $18M ARR
Year 2: 800 × $45,000 = $36M ARR
Year 3: 800 × $45,000 = $36M ARR
```

**3-Year Total: $90M incremental ARR from improved win rates**

---

### C. Reduced Churn (Retention Impact)

**Assumptions**:
- Current annual churn rate: 8%
- AI-enabled customer churn rate: 5% (stronger product stickiness)
- Average customer value: $50,000

**Calculations**:

```
Current annual churn loss:
15,000 customers × 8% × $50,000 = $60M churned ARR

With AI features:
15,000 customers × 5% × $50,000 = $37.5M churned ARR

Annual churn reduction: $22.5M retained ARR

3-Year cumulative impact: ~$70M retained ARR
```

**3-Year Total: $70M retained ARR**

---

### D. Usage-Based Revenue

**Assumptions**:
- 30% of customers use metered features (content generation, AI analysis)
- Average usage-based revenue: $500/month per active user
- Average 50 active users per customer

**Calculations**:

```
Year 1 (10% AI adoption):
1,500 customers × 30% usage × 50 users × $500/mo × 6 months = $11.25M

Year 2 (25% AI adoption):
3,750 customers × 30% usage × 50 users × $500/mo × 12 months = $33.75M

Year 3 (40% AI adoption):
6,000 customers × 30% usage × 50 users × $500/mo × 12 months = $54M
```

**3-Year Total: $99M usage-based revenue**

- Value realization: 70% Year 1, 90% Year 2, 100% Year 3

**Calculations**:

```
Equivalent additional capacity:
200 engineers × 1x multiplier = 200 equivalent additional engineers

Value of increased capacity:
Year 1: 200 × $200,000 × 0.70 = $28M
Year 2: 200 × $200,000 × 0.90 = $36M
Year 3: 200 × $200,000 × 1.00 = $40M
```

**3-Year Total: $104M in engineering cost avoidance**

---

### B. Faster Time-to-Market

**Assumptions**:
- Ship Claude API features 6 months earlier than with traditional development
- Market share gain from early entry: 5% of addressable market
- Addressable market (AI-powered enablement): $1B annually
- Margin: 75%

**Calculations**:

```
6-month head start revenue capture:
$1B × 5% market share × 75% margin × 0.5 years = $18.75M

Sustained advantage:
Year 1: $18.75M
Year 2: $37.5M (full year)
Year 3: $37.5M (full year)
```

**3-Year Total: $93.75M from time-to-market advantage**

---

### C. Technical Debt Reduction

**Assumptions**:
- Current estimated cost of technical debt: 20% of engineering time
- Claude Code reduces technical debt burden by 50%
- 200 engineers × $200,000 × 20% = $8M annual debt "tax"
- 50% reduction = $4M annual savings

**Calculations**:

```
Year 1: $4M × 0.5 (ramp-up) = $2M
Year 2: $4M × 0.8 = $3.2M
Year 3: $4M × 1.0 = $4M
```

**3-Year Total: $9.2M technical debt reduction**

---

### D. Reduced Customer Support Burden

**Assumptions**:
- AI-powered content discovery and generation reduces support tickets
- Current support cost: $2M annually
- AI reduces support burden by 25%

**Calculations**:

```
Annual savings: $2M × 25% = $500,000

Year 1: $250,000 (half-year effect)
Year 2: $500,000
Year 3: $500,000
```

**3-Year Total: $1.25M support cost savings**

## Part 3: Investment Required

### A. Anthropic Claude API Costs

**Assumptions**:
- Token pricing: $3/MTok input, $15/MTok output (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)
- Average content generation: 10K input + 2K output tokens
- Average deal analysis: 150K input + 4K output tokens
- Average search query: 5K input + 500 output tokens

**Usage Projections**:

```
Year 1 (10% customer adoption):
- Content generations: 500,000/month × (10K + 2K tokens) = 6B tokens/month
- Deal analyses: 50,000/month × (150K + 4K tokens) = 7.7B tokens/month
- Search queries: 2M/month × (5K + 500 tokens) = 11B tokens/month

Total tokens: ~25B/month = 300B/year
Cost with caching (50% reduction): $3M/month × 12 = $36M Year 1

Year 2 (25% adoption): $90M
Year 3 (40% adoption): $144M
```

**Note**: Volume pricing and aggressive caching should reduce these numbers by 30-50%.

**Optimized Estimates**:
- Year 1: $25M
- Year 2: $60M
- Year 3: $90M

**3-Year Total: $175M**
